In practice, it is common for us to compute many prefixes in one computation, as this enables us to take advantage of GPU parallelism and also obtain better gradient approximations (we'll talk more about the latter point later). This is called *batching*, where each prefix is an example in a larger batch. Here, you'll redo the computations from the previous cells, but instead of having one prefix, you'll have a batch of two prefixes. The final output of this cell should be a 2x5 matrix that contains two probability distributions, one for each prefix. **NOTE: YOU WILL LOSE POINTS IF YOU USE ANY LOOPS IN YOUR ANSWER!** Your code should be completely vectorized (a few large computations is faster than many smaller ones)."

Your summary should answer the following questions: what is its motivation? Why should anyone care about it? Were there things in the paper that you didn't understand at all? What were they?

        "Dialogue systems used in the real world must have the ability to recognize out-of-scope(OOS)circumstances. Although a perfect system would respond effectively in all conversational contexts, this is impossible since training data are limited and user inputs are not. When the model faces circumstances not addressed during training, such as novel user intentions, domain changes, or bespoke entities, out-of-distribution problems arise. Although previous approaches to OOS identification in text have showed considerable potential, they frequently presuppose that they would have access to enough labeled OOS data for training, which is impractical in open-world situations. This paper propose a method of Generating Out-of-scope Labels with Data augmentation (GOLD) to improve OOS.\n",

        "The task of out-of-distribution dialogues can be formulated as follows: Let $D_{direct} = \\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\}$ be a target dataset with a mix of in-scope and out-of-scope dialogues. The input context \n",

The desired output $y_i ∈ [0, 1]$ is a binary label representing whether that context is out-of-scope, As a result the model should calculate: $P_{Θ}(y_i|x_i)$. In contrast, the problem tackled in this paper is indirect prediction, where only a limited or nonexistent number of OOS examples are available during training. \n",

        "The provided method, GOLD, starts with target data and sample to create a seed set. This set only obtais 1% of the size of the training set of $OOS_{known}$ and this is similar to observing OOS examples in the dev set for tuning params. In the next step, they extract matches from external source dataset which are similar os $OOS{_known}$ into shared embedding space and finally keep the closest 1000 source dialogues in cosine distance as \"matches\". After extracting these matches, we can generate some candidates. In this step, they replace a user utternace in an $OOS_{known}$ example with a match. Each new dialogue with swapped uttances now becomes a \"candidate\". The final step is running elections. It includes these three steps:\n",
